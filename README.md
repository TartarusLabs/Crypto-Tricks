# Crypto Tricks

This repo is a collection of proof-of-concepts, examples, essays and experiments in cryptography, cryptanalysis, steganography, steganalysis and covert channels that I originally wrote in 2015.

Individual sub-directories have their own README.md files describing their contents in detail.

Topics covered include:

* Implementation of a covert storage channel between two isolated processes
* Linear cryptanalysis attack against a block cipher
* Correlation attack against a stream cipher
* LSB steganography using pseudorandom password-based embedding 
* Steganalysis of images using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) measures of image quality degradation
* Side channel attacks and countermeasures
